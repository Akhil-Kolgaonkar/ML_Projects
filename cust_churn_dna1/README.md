# The Project is designed to load, calculate and predict chrun data from the customer dataset :  
> Project: Customer Churn Analysis

Customer churn is a common problem faced by many businesses. It refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. In this project, you'll analyze a dataset containing information about customer interactions and purchases to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer churn. Here are the steps you can follow:

Load the data into a pandas dataframe.
Clean and preprocess the data as necessary (e.g., removing missing values, formatting columns).
Calculate basic statistics and visualizations for the data (e.g., number of customers, total revenue, average order size, customer demographics).
Identify patterns and correlations between variables that may be related to customer churn (e.g., time since last purchase, frequency of purchases, customer reviews).
Build predictive models to identify factors that contribute to customer churn and make recommendations for improving customer retention.
To complete this project, you'll need to use data analysis tools such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. You'll also need to have knowledge of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. This project can be a great way to showcase your skills as a data analyst and demonstrate your ability to provide valuable insights to businesses.

Below is code output for a customer churn analysis project using Python and scikit-learn library for building a predictive model:

```
This code assumes that the CSV file is named customer_data.csv and is located in the same directory as the Python script.
